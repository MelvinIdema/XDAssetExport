# XDAssetExporter
AssetExport is a plugin for Adobe XD build to extract all colors in your Assets to either SASS or CSS variables. Simple but effective for an easier workflow.

## Story
AssetExporter is a plugin build specifically for design systems. Instead of copying all your colors one by one and add them as variables to your SASS or CSS files, AssetExporter copies all your colors at once and put them in your clipboard. This way it's easy to add your color system to your (S)CSS files and kickstart your project.
