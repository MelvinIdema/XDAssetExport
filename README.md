# XDAssetExport
AssetExport is a plugin build specifically for design systems. Instead of copying all your colors one by one and add them as variables to your SASS or CSS files, AssetExporter copies all your colors at once and put them in your clipboard. This way it's easy to add your color system to your (S)CSS files and kickstart your project. 

## Output:
AssetExport insert the variables inside your clipboard, so you can easily share or import them in your own projects.

###### Export to SCSS:
```
$colorname: #color;
$colorname: #color;
$colorname: #color;
```

###### Export to CSS:
```
--colorname: #color;
--colorname: #color;
--colorname: #color;
```
